        This is Tugboat Terror! A frantic task manager where you play as Alessandro, a fish with human legs
        who wants to cross the swamp.<br><br>
        This game was made alongside four other computer science students and over a 14 week semester. It was
        made in a custom engine where many components were taken from a concurrent course where we learned about
        game engine architecture and design.<br><br>
