    <p class="textDark">This is Tugboat Terror! A frantic task manager where you play as Alessandro, a fish with human legs
        who wants to cross the swamp.<br><br>
        This game was made alongside four other computer science students and over a 14 week semester. It was
        made in a custom engine where many components were taken from a concurrent course where we learned about
        game engine architecture and design.<br><br>

    <h2>Code Examples</h2>
    <p class="textDark">One interesting feature that I was able to create was a quick-and-dirty level editor given the time frame.<br><br>
    The idea was to make a textDark file where you could place the rocks and swarms quickly to make new levels. One of the best parts 
    about the design of Tugboat Terror is that each level is the same but just a different color. This also would translate to the right minimap screen.

    <p class="textDark">This screenshot shows how periods (.) are lined up in a rectangle where the length is calculated on initialization<br><br>
    The ampersands (@) are rocks and the percents (%) are swarms. <br><br><br>Doing this results in an exact grid however, which is 
    easily fixed my adding a random length and direction to each obstacle which makes them appear more natural. </p>
