    <h1>DREAD IT</h1>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
    <p class="text">My current project, DREAD IT is a mysterious, single-player 
        game focused on exploration, strategy, and execution. In DREAD IT, you 
        play Peggy Caine, a retired cop turned Private Investigator. However, 
        an alarming number of reports come into her office of various disturbances 
        around the city, and a love for hunting monsters is awakened.

        Made in a custom 2D engine using C++ and OpenGL.

    <h2>Pillar Graphics Engine</h2>
    <p class="text">PGE is the general graphics interface for our engine. I wanted to 
        create a sort of library of OpenGL calls abstracted beneath an interface. Sample
        code is hard to show for this so I'll provide a graphic below:
