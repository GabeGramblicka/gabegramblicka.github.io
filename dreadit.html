    <p class="text">My current project, DREAD IT is a mysterious, single-player 
        game focused on exploration, strategy, and execution. In DREAD IT, you 
        play Peggy Caine, a retired cop turned Private Investigator. However, 
        an alarming number of reports come into her office of various disturbances 
        around the city, and a love for hunting monsters is awakened.
