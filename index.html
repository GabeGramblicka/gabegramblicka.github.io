            My journey with games started out young as with many others.
            As I neared adulthood, I became captivated with technically and emotionally complex games 
            and their impact on the world. I knew that I had to be apart 
            of something so great. So I combined my favorite academic subject, math
            and hobby, video games to become a programmer in the industry.
            <br><br>Now, I am a computer science student at DigiPen 
            Institute of Technology in Redmond, WA, USA focusing on game engine
            architecture and graphics. With this, I continue to live out my 
            passion for making creative and 
            unique games on team environments.
