                My journey with games started out young as with many others.
                As I neared adulthood, I became captivated with technically and emotionally complex games 
                and their impact on the world. I knew that I had to be a part 
                of something so great. So I combined my favorite academic subject, math,
                and hobby, video games, to become a programmer in the industry.
                <br><br>Now, I am a computer science student at DigiPen 
                Institute of Technology in Redmond, WA, USA focusing on game engine
                architecture and graphics. With this, I continue to live out my 
                passion for making creative and 
                unique games on team environments.
