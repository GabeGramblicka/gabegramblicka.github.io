                Growing up, I became captivated with technically and emotionally complex games 
                and their impact on the world. I knew that I had to be a part 
                of something so great. So I combined my favorite academic subject, math,
                and hobby, video games, to become a programmer in the industry.
                <br><br>Now, I am a computer science student at DigiPen 
                Institute of Technology in Redmond, WA, USA focusing on game engine
                architecture and graphics. With this, I continue to live out my 
                passion for making creative and 
                unique games on team environments.

                Here are two games that I have made so far at my time at DigiPen. <br><br><br><br><br>
                The first game, Getaway was made in a 7 week time frame in the first semeseter. 
                It was to be written in C using an in house engine called CProcessing. <br><br>
                The second game, Tugboat Terror, also written in C, was made in a 14 week period using
                a custom engine built alongside an engine architecture course.
