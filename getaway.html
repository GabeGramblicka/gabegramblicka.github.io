    <h1>Getaway</h1>
    <p class="text">Welcome to a 2D topdown stealth experience where you play as a robber 
        whose get away car has left without him!<br><br>
        This game was made alongside two other programmers in computer science degrees. We were given half
        of a semester (around 7 weeks) to create a game from start to finish, using an in house engine called 
        CProcessing.<br><br>
